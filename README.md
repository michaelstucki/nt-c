# nt-c
Based on word count, this program evenly divides the books of
the New Testament into a user-specified number of sets (i.e.,
the number of verses to memorize each day) such that the total
word count of each set is nearly the same for each set.
The word count for each book is from the NA28 Greek text.

To compile, run "make".
To execute, run "./nt".
Results are in "nt_log.txt"
